# Spam-random-shit

Hey y'all!

When Linus' new video dropped, I noticed the TechTok that told people to go to prnt.sc/ and put two random alphabets and 4 random numbers. I found this rather tedious. Soo, I made a bot to do it for me. 

 
This is a python program that spams random screenshots from a Russian hosting website that has screenshots people saved on their phones/laptops. 

Feel free to mess around with the timings on your own. 

Kindaly do not use this in public channels or for malicious purposes.
